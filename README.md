# New way to maintain settings in ABAP
Time to time constants appears in your code.  Some time constants are less constant.  They have different types for example date of feature start, rfc_dest to other system, and number of parallel tasks. 

To maintain settings you have to create a table of 1 row or class for constant. Both this way has different costs to create settings, add settings, and change settings. Less is better.

And you have tens of table of 1 row that replicate each other.

I have solution that have best part of both way to maintain settings. Easy to create, easy add, easy maintain. As bonus you can have documentation for settings like flag_25 type xfeld.

We can hold 
+ single value
+ single structure
+ table of value
+ table of struct


to hold this different variables in one table I serialized them in json and save in table of text255

to read settings:
+ select data
+ join string
+ deserealizate

# After installation navigate to screen #2

We need to adjust something 

Make layout bigger

Activate!

to describe you settings go to **ZTR_GS_CONFIG** (Global Settings Configuration).

First level – project name

![comparison](img/img_12.png "comparison")

Second level variables of this project
1. Name of variable / structure / table
2. Short description
3. Abap type. For data elemet there is obligatory that this element were used in table or structure
4. Sign that it is table. You can’t use table type

![comparison](img/img_13.png "comparison")

Third level is long decscription what this settings for, how they change program flow, what possible value can hold

![comparison](img/img_14.png "comparison")

Changes save in transport request.

To edit value of settings go to **ZTR_GS_EDITOR** in each system( development, quality, production )

Enter project name or search.

In variable block list all settings of this project. You can view or change by click on var name.

You cannot use structure or table with include with suffixes like this
